# Requirement Phase 2

## Itinerary Generation and Booking Workflow

1.  **Initial Itinerary Generation:** After collecting all necessary information about the trip, the system will automatically generate a detailed itinerary.
2.  **Explanation:** The system will present the generated itinerary to the user with an explanation of the choices made (e.g., why certain cities, activities, or hotels were selected).
3.  **User Feedback and Iteration:** The user will be prompted to review the itinerary and suggest changes. The user can request modifications to cities, places, activities, experiences, hotels, flights, or the overall itinerary design.
4.  **Itinerary Modification:** The system will update the itinerary based on the user's feedback.
5.  **Booking Confirmation:** Once the user is satisfied with the itinerary, the system will ask for confirmation to proceed with booking flights and hotels.
6.  **Booking and Notification:** Upon user confirmation, the system will book all the necessary tickets and accommodations. After booking, a confirmation email with all ticket details and the final itinerary will be sent to the user.
