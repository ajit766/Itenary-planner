1. Always give a glimpse on how you are going to develop and wait for my approval before executing and actually implementing it.
2. Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or
library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP
tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
